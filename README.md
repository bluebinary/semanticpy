# SemanticPy

The SemanticPy library for Python provides a simplified and consistent way to create JSON-LD documents from Python source code constructs such as classes and properties.

### Requirements

The SemanticPy library has been tested with Python 3.10 and 3.11, but should work with some earlier Python versions such as 3.9, 3.8, and possibly 3.7, but has not been tested against these versions. It was not designed to work with Python 2 or earlier.

### Installation

The SemanticPy library is available from the PyPi repository, so may be added to a project's dependencies via its `requirements.txt` file or similar by referencing the SemanticPy library's name, `semanticpy`, or the library may be installed directly onto your local development system using `pip install` by entering the following command:

	$ pip install semanticpy
